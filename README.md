# Beers :beer:
Or America's latest obsession 

## Abstract :page_facing_up:
The sense of belonging has always been an important human factor, whether it’s in opinion formation, judgement, or decision making. Cleveland people, for example, will usually root for their local NFL team, the Browns, even though that same team ends up last pretty much every season! The sense of belonging does not necessarily mean an emotional connection though, it might also express a sort of camaraderie, a sense of mutual support in financial matters. According to studies, consumers are more likely to consume local, especially for beers, which are getting more popular by the year in the US. 
This project focuses on the local aspect of beers, where 

a brewery located in the same state as the user is referred to as a "local" brewery, while others are "outsiders". 

in search of correlations between users' geographical - possibly emotional - proximity to the brewery and an eventual bias towards or against the provided product. The study is limited to the Unites States and is made at the States scale.



## Research Questions :thinking:
* Does the brewery's location influence users' reviews? <br>
* Do consumers prefer local or foreign beers? <br>
* How important is local support for breweries to increase sales in foreign states? <br>
* How does the burgeoning of craft beer breweries reflect users' bias for their hometown beers?
