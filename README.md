# Beers :beer:
Or America's latest obsession 

## Abstract :page_facing_up:
The sense of belonging has always been an important human factor, whether it’s in opinion formation, judgment, or decision making. Cleveland people, for example, will usually root for their local NFL team, the Browns, even though that same team ends up last pretty much every season! The sense of belonging does not exclusively mean an emotional connection though, it might also express a sort of camaraderie, a sense of mutual support in financial matters. But how does this apply to beers? <br>
Beers are the most social alcoholic drinks out there: whether it’s with friends or coworkers, beers are the usual go-to in outdoor social gatherings. But how easy is it to dissociate one’s opinion about the beer from the memories that come with it? Does the sense of belonging to a group influence our supposedly impartial judgment of the product? In this project, we turn to the datasets provided by 2 major beer rating websites, BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, in search of user bias towards “local” breweries. A brewery is labeled “local” if it is located in the same state as the user, and “outsider” otherwise.



## Research Questions :thinking:
* Does the brewery's location influence users' reviews? <br>
* Do consumers prefer local or foreign beers? <br>
* How important is local support for breweries to increase sales in foreign states? <br>
* How does the burgeoning of craft beer breweries reflect users' bias for their hometown beers? 


## Proposed Additional Datasets :books:


* **[beer - worldwide](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/alcoholic-drinks/beer/worldwide)** <br>

* **[Craft breweries per capita in 2021  in the US](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?src=2&query=U.S.%20craft%20beer%20breweries%20per%20capita%202021%2C%20by%20state&docid=L2cvMTFwd2Y1NzR5NA%3D%3D)** <br>
The number of craft breweries per capita illustrates the involvement of the users in the beer market and reflects the potential bias for their hometown beers.
* **[ Major beer vendor market share in the United States from 2014 to 2021](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?src=2&query=Major%20beer%20vendor%20market%20share%20in%20the%20United%20States%20from%202014%20to%202021&docid=L2cvMTFyOW1iYm5jdw%3D%3D)** <br>
This is to have an idea on the leading beer suppliers in the US overtime.
